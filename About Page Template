Copy this code when adding new pages. To create new pages, on your Blogger Dashboard go to Pages and hit 'New Page' button. Make sure to add a Page Title at the top right away! This will make blogger create a nice URL to your page.

--INSERT TEXT--

1. To add the page title in the text, replace only 'PAGE TITLE' in the code below.
2. To add description or text, replace only 'Hi! I’m Sample Text, a bit of information about me and what I do.'
3. To add your own email replace 'your.email@gmail.com' with your own email. Do not forget to do it in both places!
4. To add your own social media links replace 'URL1/2' with a link and 'Social Media Link 1/2' with the name of the website, like Twitter.
5. If you want to make more paragraphs, add the following code TWO TIMES at the beginning of a new paragraph:

<br />

6. If you want Font Awesome Icons at the bottom of all the text you entered, paste in this sample code AFTER all the other code below:

<br /><br /><br />
<p style="font-size: 20px;">
<a href="LINK URL" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="LINK URL" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="LINK URL" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-artstation"></i></a></p><br />

7. Replace LINK URL with a link to the website/social media account you're adding. To replace or add different websites than those in the sample, copy the 'fab fa-xyz' of the one you want from the Font Awesome Icons https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/Font%20Awesome%20Icons and replace those you don't want with it. If the list doesn't have what you'd like, you can find more on the official Font Awesome page https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery
8. If you want more icons than three, add each just under the first one and follow this same formula:

<a href="LINK URL" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-xyz"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

* &nbsp;&nbsp; is a code that adds spacing between icons. It is needed between them, but not after the very last one.
** target="_blank" is a piece of code that forces your link to open in a new tab.
