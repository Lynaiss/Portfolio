DOWNLOAD THIS README BECAUSE GITHUB NATIVELY MESSES WITH THE CODE CHUNKS WRITTEN IN HERE AS EXAMPLES

IMPORTANT UPDATE: Blogger has a slightly different interface now (September 5th 2020) so when going to the Theme page, to Restore or Edit HTML you have to click the dropdown menu icon just beside CUSTOMIZE. To set what theme is used on mobile in the same menu go to Mobile Settings.

This is a simple grid portfolio code to be used on Blogger! It is a heavily adjusted Colorlibâ€™s Shutter theme (it's lower on the list) https://colorlib.com/wp/free-blogger-templates/


--INSTALLATION--

* Dark version and Navbar variants have been added to v2. Light one has no denominator. To view screenshots of both go to Theme Samples. Download only one of these versions and follow instructions with that one.  https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/Theme%20Samples%20v2.jpg

1. To use this theme, Download the version you want. Download links:
Light - https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/Portfolio%20Theme%20by%20Colorlib%20via%20Lynaiss%20v2.zip
Dark - https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/DARK%20Portfolio%20Theme%20by%20Colorlib%20via%20Lynaiss%20v2.zip
Navbar Light- https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/NAVBAR%20Portfolio%20Theme%20by%20Colorlib%20via%20Lynaiss%20v2.zip
Navbar Dark - https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/NAVBAR%20DARK%20Portfolio%20Theme%20by%20Colorlib%20via%20Lynaiss%20v2.zip

The file is a .zip file to prevent github from messing with the code. Unzip it after download. You will get an .xml file with the same name - this is what you will be using. If using Navbar variant, scroll down to the NAVBAR GUIDE

2. Select Simple themes on blogger when making a new blog.
3. Then on Blogger Dashboard go to Theme. 
4. Hit the dropdown menu by the Customize button and select Restore. Click Upload in the window that opens and find the .xml file you downloaded. Upload it.
5. The theme is now applied to your blog!
6. In the same dropdown menu click on the Mobile Settings. In the window that opens select 'Desktop' and hit Save! This will force your theme to load on mobile too instead of Blogger's default one.
7. Hit Settings icon and go to Basic. There in Title and Description enter your info. This is what will in future show in Google search results and when you link your website.
8. Blogger adds a lot of junk widgets so when you have your theme set up, go to Layout and remove any widgets that are not show in the Widget Samples attachment; https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/Widget%20Samples.jpg . You can do that by hitting Edit at the bottom right of every widget and hitting Remove button in the window that opens up. Most likely you won't have to touch anything in the purple sidebar in the Layout. If using the Navbar variant, just disregard this step.


--HEADER--

Add personal info.

1. On Blogger Dashboard go to Layout.
2. To customize the Header, click Edit on the HTML/Javascript tab under Header title. This is in the purple left sidebar.
3. Change ONLY the following parts of the code in it:
    YOUR NAME
    What you do
4. Hit Save button!


--NAVIGATION--

Add and edit the navigation links.

1. To add pages, on Blogger Dashboard go to Layout. 
2. Click Edit on the FIRST Pages tab under Navigation Menu title. This is in the purple left sidebar. Any pages you created will be selectable.
3. To add your email and remove the placeholder one, in the same window hit X on the placeholder. Hit + Add external link. For Page title enter either the full email address or something like 'Email' or 'Contact'. In Web address (URL) enter the email link. This has the form of mailto:your.email@gmail.com but replace your.email@gmail.com with your own.
4. This theme supports having art categories via Labels. If you do not wish to use them, hit Edit and then Remove button on the following items:
    HTML/Javascript tab under the Navigation Menu
    SECOND Pages tab under the Navigation Menu
5. If any of the sections after the Header have big and bold titles, you can remove them by clicking Edit and deleting anything entered in the Title (optional).
6. Do not forget to hit Save button in every window!


--POSTS--

To maintain the uniform look of your posts, follow the next steps. To have each image as a thumbnail, post them individually. Multiple images on the same post will not display as thumbnail, only the first one. Thumbnails load from latest to oldest.

1. Copy the code in the 'Posts Template' https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/Posts%20Template
2. On your Blogger Dashboard, go to Settings > Posts, comments and sharing
3. In the Post Template part paste the code you copied. Don't forget to hit Save Settings button!
4. To make a new post, on your Blogger Dashboard go to Posts and hit the New post button.
5. The post template the code will be applied. Make sure to switch to HTML tab to see the instructions. Follow them to make sure nothing looks off! Do not forget to hit Publish when done!
6. To make sure no strange things happens on your post, on your Blogger Dashboard go to Layout.
7. In the Main section hit Edit on the Blog Posts tab.
8. In the following window uncheck ALL Post Page options.
9. In the same window you can also set the number of posts to show on your home page. It is recommended to keep this in the 10-20 range. Do not forget to hit Save button when done!
11. To prevent images opening in a lightbox and redirecting straight to where they can be downloaded, on your Blogger Dashboard go to Settings > Posts, comments and sharing.
12. There, set Showcase images with Lightbox to 'No'. Do not forget to hit Save settings!
13. The image and post width is 650px. You may upload larger images but they will be downscaled. Do try to make your file names something like 'Artwork Name by Your Name' so whoever downloads it can easily find you again.
14. Homepage posts will be displayed in order they were published, from newer to older. Same applies to the categories. To change the order, on the Blogger Dashboard go to Posts and select any posts you want to move. Hit Revert to draft button.
15. Then hover over a post and hit Edit. In the posts's page on the right hit Schedule and select Set date and time. Choose one that will move the post up or down. Do not forget to hit Done to apply it and Publish to post!

* Make sure when uploading things directly to blogger and adding them to your post to select 'Original Size' in the size settings for every image. Otherwise they WILL get compressed by blogger and become less crisp. This is very important!
** To display image titles on hover when viewing thumbnails, make sure to entre Title in the top part of the post editor, not just into the code mentioned in the Post Template!

--LABELS--

If you wish to use categories, utilize labels!

1. When making your post, hit the Labels on the right and enter whichever you want to use.
2. If you already made a post, you can add them by placing a checkmark beside the post when viewing a list of all the ones you made. Hit the tag icon at the top and select either the existing label or create a new one.
3. After you have posts labeled, find the link to them. Blogger uses the following format: 
https://YOURNAME.blogspot.com/search/label/NAME?m=1
4. In the above link replace YOURNAME with the name of your website. Replace NAME with the name of your label. These links are CASE SENSITIVE. If your label is written Like This your label link will be https://YOURNAME.blogspot.com/search/label/Like-This?m=1 (tip: if your category has several words, best write the labels themselves like-this so there are no issues linking to it)
5. To add navigation links to your categories, on your Blogger Dashboard go to Layout.
6. Click Edit on SECOND Pages tab under Navigation Menu. This is in the purple left sidebar.This is in the purple left sidebar.
7. In the window that opens hit + Add external link.
8. In Page title enter whatever you wish your category to be called as in navigation, like 'Portraits'.
9. In Web address (URL) enter your label link from earlier! Hit Save Link button.
10. Do not forget to hit Save when you finish adding all your categories!

* ?m=1 is actually a mobile addition. The code that makes the category you're viewing bolded in navigation does not work on mobile if this is not used, so it's recommended to include in your label links.


--PAGES APPEARANCE--

To maintain a nice look on pages, follow the next steps.

1. Copy the code in the 'About Page Template' https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/About%20Page%20Template
2. On your Blogger Dashboard go to Pages and hit the New page button.
3. Make sure to first enter the Page title at the top! This will ensure the web address of the page has nothing weird going on in it!
4. Switch to HTML tab if it's not selected already.
5. In the big part paste the code. Follow the instructions in it to make sure nothing looks off! Do not forget to hit Publish when done!


--FONT AWESOME ICONS--

Use at your own risk! This is bugged! Icons seem to have a load stutter and are slow to render. Version v5.11.2 supported.

1. To add social media icons to the sidebar, on your Blogger Dashboard go to Layout.
2. Under Social Links title click Edit on Social Links tab.
3. In the window that opens to the New Site Name add font awesome code for the specific icon. The code looks like this, just add < and > at the very beginning and end: 
i class="fab fa-twitter"></i
4. To the New Site URL add your link to the social media. Hit Add Link.
5. When you're done do not forget to hit Save button!
6. You can find more social media codes in the Font Awesome Icons file! https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/Font%20Awesome%20Icons
7. If you don't want any social icons on the home page, go to Layout. Find Social Links widget in the purple sidebar. Hit Edit button. In the window that opens (Look at Social Links Widget Collapsed; https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/Social%20Links%20Widget%20Collapsed.JPG ) you can hit Delete on all the icons that came in there with the theme. Don't remove the widget itself in case you want to use it later.
8. If you want to edit the icons already there and add your own links, click on the Edit text. This will open each icon field for you to edit. Look at Social Links Widget Open for a screenshot; https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/Social%20Links%20Widget%20Open.JPG

* You can also add Font Awesome Icons to your About Page. For instructions on that, go to the About Page Template https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio/blob/master/About%20Page%20Template


--NAVBAR GUIDE--

These versions do not support: 
 - Social Icons in navigation
 - Separate art categories via Labels. You can still add your categories as normal pages but there is a limit. Past it the link text in navigation gets broken.

Add your pages in the Layout as normal, majority of the steps mentioned in NAVIGATION do not apply here. Replace things however you like, and be mindful of labels if using them (look through LABELS for pointers on how to write them and what link fromat Blogger uses for them). Things outlined in HEADER do not apply to this version.   

WARNING: All of the following steps are to be done WITHIN the HTML of the theme. I have not found a way to make this more user friendly at the time. Some basic understanding of HTML is necessary.

1. Find the following bit of text: YOUR NAME 
2. Replace it with your name or username
3. Find the following text: What You Do
4. Replace it with a short tagline, such as Freelance Illustrator or Ceoncept Artist
5. Pages list for navigation on mobile has to be manually entered. 
6. In the code find the exact phrase: 'home'
7. The first instance of it is within a chunk of code that you can copy. It would look something similar to the following (link titles and links might be different depending on what you set up; do NOT copy this chunk of code, it is just an example, copy one in your blog's HTML):

<![CDATA[{'home': {'href': 'https://testymctest2.blogspot.com/', 'title': 'Home', 'position': 0}, 'link0': {'href': 'https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio', 'title': 'Download Theme', 'position': 1}, 'link1': {'href': 'https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio', 'title': 'Theme Documentation', 'position': 2}, 'link2': {'href': 'mailto:placeholder@gmail.com', 'title': 'Email', 'position': 3}, 'link3': {'href': 'https://YOURNAME.blogspot.com/search/label/NAME1?m\x3d1', 'title': 'Label Name 1', 'position': 4}, 'link4': {'href': 'https://YOURNAME.blogspot.com/search/label/NAME2?m\x3d1', 'title': 'Label Name 2', 'position': 5}}]]>

8. Next, find the THIRD instance of the following code : 'home'
9. You will see the same chunk of code like in the previous step. It would look something like this:

<![CDATA[{'home': {'href': 'https://testymctest2.blogspot.com/', 'title': 'Home', 'position': 0}, 'link0': {'href': 'https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio', 'title': 'Theme Documentation', 'position': 1}, 'link1': {'href': 'https://github.com/Lynaiss/Portfolio', 'title': 'Download Theme', 'position': 2}, 'link2': {'href': 'mailto:placeholder@gmail.com', 'title': 'EmailÅ¡', 'position': 3}, 'link3': {'href': 'https://YOURNAME.blogspot.com/search/label/NAME1?m\x3d1', 'title': 'Label Name 1', 'position': 4}, 'link4': {'href': 'https://YOURNAME.blogspot.com/search/label/NAME2?m\x3d1', 'title': 'Label Name 2', 'position': 5}}]]>

10. Select it and paste in the code you copied earlier. Save the theme and your setup should be complete!


--SEARCH RESULTS--

Adjust how your page shows up in search results. All of this is located in the --META-- section, but preview image is the only thing in the --START CUSTOM CODE-- section.

1. On Blogger Dashboard go to Theme and hit Edit HTML button.
2. In the code that opens find the following bit of text:
    Simple grid view portfolio theme for artists made by Colorlib and edited by Lynaiss.
3. Replace it with a short description of what the website is for. This will show in Google Search results. 'Illustration portfolio of Your Name' is a good choice.
4. Find this bit of text:
    write,tags,like,this,include,your name,and,what,you do,you can add,as,many as you want
5. Replace it with any tags that apply to your website. Make sure to include your name and types of art you do. They are separated with commas, like in the placeholder version.
6. Replace Your Name and your.email@gmail.com right below the tags as well. 
7. Find the following bit of text: 
    URL to preview image
8. Replace it with the link to an image you want displayed as thumbnail when sharing your link. Most images you're trying to link have a .hpg or -png at the end.
9. When done, do not forget to hit Save theme!

* To have a preview image as a favicon in the blog tab when viewing it via a browser as well, go to Settings. Navigate to Basic section of it and hit 'Favicon'. In there you can upload your icon.


--GOOGLE ANALYTICS & SEARCH CONSOLE--
