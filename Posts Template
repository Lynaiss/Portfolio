WHEN YOU'RE READY TO POST YOUR POST, DELETE THE FIRST SAMPLE IMAGE CODE IN THIS INSTRUCTIONS SECTION OR IT WILL RENDER AS THUMBNAIL! 

--INSERT IMAGE GUIDE--

In the template code select the sample image code or click before or after it. To add images hit the Insert Image button. Either choose to add image from your Blogger or upload it from your computer. When prompted set Original Size and None for border for the image. New image will load above or below existing one. To remove a sample one delete its code. It is as follows:

--REMOVE EXTRA CODE--

*The sample image has the code with all the extra bits blogger adds removed. Keep it as reference in the template if you'd like!
By default blogger adds images with some extra code to them that indet them on mobile view. To get rid of that, in the HTML view remove the following bits of code:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" 
</div>

--TITLE AND DESCRIPTION--

Add title and description by replacing the following:

Title
Description

--ADDITIONAL NOTES--
Add Title in the blogger's Title section above the post window. This will render as image title when you hover over the image thumbnail on the main pages.
Add this title first and then go to Permalink tab on the right. In it select 'Custom Permalink' and give your post a nice URL. The date tag of the URL can't be changed.
